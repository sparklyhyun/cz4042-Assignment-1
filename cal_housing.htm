<H1>California Housing</H1>
<P>This is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. Here is the included 
description:
<P>S&amp;P Letters Data<BR>We collected information on the variables using all 
the block groups in California from the 1990 Cens us. In this sample a block 
group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically co mpact 
area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the 
population density. W e computed distances among the centroids of each block 
group as measured in latitude and longitude. W e excluded all the block groups 
reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. T he final 
data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is 
ln(median house value).
